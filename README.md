# Fuzzy-Logic-ABS-and-Yaw-Control-System
This repository presents two versions of an Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) controller:
  -PID-based ABS Controller: using anti-windup digital PID for slip regulation.
  -Fuzzy Logic ABS Controller: using Mamdani fuzzy inference and a yaw correction module.
Both were implemented and validated in MATLAB/Simulink under various driving scenarios.
