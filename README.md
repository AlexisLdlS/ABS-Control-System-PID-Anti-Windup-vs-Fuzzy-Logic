# Fuzzy-Logic-ABS-and-Yaw-Control-System
Designed and validated an ABS system using fuzzy logic in Simulink. Estimated wheel slip using IMU and wheel speed sensors; implemented a Mamdani-type fuzzy controller for brake pressure modulation. Developed a secondary control block to reduce yaw in split-Î¼ scenarios by adjusting lateral braking force. Achieved a 30% reduction in braking time and 35% in stopping distance under uneven road conditions. Integrated Riemann-based estimations, multiple control iterations, and real-time sensor processing for robust response.
