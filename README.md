# ABS-Control-System-PID-Anti-Windup-vs-Fuzzy-Logic
This repository presents two versions of an Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) controller:

  -PID-based ABS Controller: using anti-windup digital PID for slip regulation.
  
  -Fuzzy Logic ABS Controller: using Mamdani fuzzy inference and a yaw correction module.
  
Both systems were tested under realistic driving conditions, including emergency braking at high speeds and surface changes (e.g. split-Œº scenarios). The controllers regulate brake pressure based on real-time sensor signals (wheel speed, master cylinder pressure, IMU). 

Each controller was implemented within a code-based Simulink block, mimicking the application-layer logic that would typically run on an ECU.

## NOTES
For running and simulating the model: 
- Following ADD-On needs to be instaled in Simulink: Vehicle Dynamics Blockset by MathWorks

Steps for executing the simulation:

1.- Open the ABS_Project Folder

2.- Run one of the INITIAL CONFIG SCRIPTs (Init_*.m)

  Script will define:

  - Sampling period of the inputs to simulation and the controller.
  - Multiple model parameters.
  - Surface definition. Coefficients of fricition for the wheels.
  - The maneuver to be carried out by a ficticious driver, based on throttle, brake and steering inputs.

3.- Open the Main System Simulink Model File (Main_A.slx)

4.- Enable/Disable 3D Simulation Movie: go to Visualization block and double click the "3D Engine" block, selecting the corresponding option and return to Main Model Block.

5.- Run the simulation by pressing the Run Button (F5)
