# Fuzzy-Logic-ABS-and-Yaw-Control-System
Designed and validated an ABS system using fuzzy logic in Simulink which estimate wheel slip using IMU and wheel speed sensors, a Mamdani-type fuzzy controller for brake pressure modulation and includes a secondary control block to reduce yaw in split-Î¼ scenarios by adjusting lateral braking force.
